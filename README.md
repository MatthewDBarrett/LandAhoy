Need to use NODE.js to run in browser.
Using NODE.js, follow the steps below to run code:

npm install - g http-server
cd (directory)
http-server -c-1

1. npm install - g http-server
2. cd (directory address)
3. http-server -c-1


NOTE: step 1 only needs to be entered for the first time running the http server
